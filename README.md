# CITS3403Project
This flask application meets the needs of cits3403 Project. 

This website is built for learning some very basic Japanese. 

We implement the login and registration functions, and store users by connecting to the database.

We build an online formative assessment for basic Japanese. After passing the evaluation, you can view each of your historical scores.
